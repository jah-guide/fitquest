## 🔐 Authentication & Security

- Users can **register and log in**
- Passwords are **securely hashed using bcrypt**
- Authentication data is stored securely in the backend database
- Input validation prevents invalid or malformed data from crashing the app

---

## 🌐 REST API & Database Integration

- FitQuest connects to a **REST API** backed by **MongoDB**
- Users can:
  - Save workouts and exercises
  - Group workouts into routines
  - Retrieve routines from the database
- All persistent workout data is stored in MongoDB and demonstrated in the video

---

## 🗄️ Offline Mode with SQLite

FitQuest supports **offline usage** through local storage:

- Workout and routine data can be accessed without internet connectivity
- Data is stored locally using **SQLite**
- Synchronization occurs when the device reconnects to the internet

This ensures usability even in low-connectivity environments.

---

## 🌍 Multi-Language Support

The application supports multiple languages, including:

- English (EN)
- Afrikaans (AFR)
- isiZulu (ZU)

Language switching is handled dynamically and updates UI text accordingly.

---

## 🎨 Theme Support (Dark / Light Mode)

- Users can toggle between **Dark Mode** and **Light Mode**
- Theme preference is persisted across app sessions
- Improves accessibility and user experience

---

## 🔔 Push Notifications (Partial Implementation)

Push notifications were explored during development.  
While the **full notification system is not yet complete**, foundational work was done toward supporting real-time user alerts.

This feature is planned for future expansion.

---

## 🧪 Automated Testing & Version Control

- The project uses **GitHub for version control**
- Regular commits were made throughout development
- The repository includes a README and well-structured codebase
- Logging is used throughout the application to demonstrate understanding of execution flow

---

## 📝 Release Notes

## 🤖 AI Tools Usage (≤ 500 Words)

AI tools were used responsibly to assist during development. Their use included:
- Debugging Dart and Flutter errors
- Improving widget structure and state handling
- Assisting with database query logic
- Drafting documentation content

All AI-generated suggestions were **reviewed, modified, and implemented manually**.  
The developer maintains full understanding and ownership of the final implementation. AI tools were used strictly as **supporting tools**, not as replacements for learning or development.
